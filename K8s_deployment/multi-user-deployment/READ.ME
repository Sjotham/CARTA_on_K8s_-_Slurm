This repository is CARTA multi user deployment where we use the CARTA Controller to spawn multiple Carta backend services. To be able to reproduce the same deployment you must have minikube, Kind, microk8s running. The mongoDB https://rohinpandey.medium.com/guide-mongodb-kubernetes-community-operator-c85faac0fc84 must be installed. You need to create extra users from https://github.com/deepin-community/libnss-extrausers, attach at filesystem.
