This repository contains multiple folders. Its main objective is to compare two deployments methods: thats Kubernetes and HPC using Slurm as resource manager. We are using Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy (CARTA) as our interactive application. So, here we have slurm configuration file because for hpc we need to set up slurm first, fake server since we wanted to do some little deployment with a dump server to see how kubespawner works and carta installation here we were installing carta in a local machine.
