Slurm is used as resource manager on HPC clusters. The scripts are met for different nodes in an HPC cluster, the login-Node.sh is installed on the login node where slurmctld run that manages the cluster, then compute-nodes.sh install surmd on compute nodes. we also need to verity that the compute nodes can ping the control node (login node), we use the scontroll ping command to ping control node.
